It's extremely shady and way to cool to brag.Camera is better than OnePlus 6T and definitely, you wouldn't like it if you compare it's pics with DSLR's. In one word, camera is too good and it's your skill how you capture the frame.90Hz display is way more crisp and sharp when compared with 60hz OnePlus 6T's.I loved the sound. 6T has Dirac HD sound which is awesome and feels like true HD but 8's sound is more cool because of Dolby. Just loved it.************** Premium Look************** Charging speed90 FPS on PUBG is available and I didn't feel any difference in 8gb OnePlus 6T ram and 6gb OnePlus 8 ram while playing PUBG.Overall, go for it.

If you watch a review by MKBHD, he also mentioned that \"Definitely the screen is not that sharp & it cannot 1080p videos\". He mentioned the same thing in his review video of iPhone 11 also.I personally used high quality AMOLED display made by Samsung. Samsung Note 8 Samsung S9 Plus OnePlus 6t & now i am using OnePlus 7 Pro. Yes i sold my iPhone XR within a week.  "
